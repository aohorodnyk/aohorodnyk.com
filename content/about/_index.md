I'm senior software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in backend development.
I have Master's degree in Software Engineering.
I'm interested in various technologies, it's the reason I created the blog.
I like cartoons and video games, but do not spend a lot of time for playing.
I'm interested in knowledge sharing and communications. Feel free to write me by any way.
