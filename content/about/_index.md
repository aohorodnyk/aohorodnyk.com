## Welcome

Welcome to a website that celebrates simplicity and clarity.

Here you will find articles that are easy to read and enjoyable to explore. I have experimented with different designs for my blog, but I always come back to the minimalistic style that lets the content shine.

This website is the result of my passion for creating and sharing.

## About me

My name is Anton Ohorodnyk[^contacts]. I have a Master’s degree in Software Engineering from National Aviation University in Kyiv.

I have commercial experience as a software engineer since 2009.

My favorite programming language is [Go](https://go.dev/). However, I believe that every developer must explore various paradigms and languages to have the ability to make the best contribution for every task/product. Therefore, I am open to doing my job in multiple languages if required by task and business.

## Content

This blog is my personal space where I express my thoughts and feelings on various topics that matter to me. I hope that by sharing my perspective, I can inspire, inform or entertain someone who reads my articles. If you want to connect with me, feel free to reach out through any of the channels available.
